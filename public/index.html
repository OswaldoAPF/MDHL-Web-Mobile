                To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods, who have an interest in learning and
                playing soccer,
                with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of soccer, specifically those skills

              <h4>General Information</h4>
              <p>
                The Mighty Ducks Hockey League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside
                neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of MDHL,
                you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL is run by a
                small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.

                        maximum
                        and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams

                        unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition
                        Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether
                        or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                        associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games
                        away.
